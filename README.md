This is a fork of [Equation Composer](https://github.com/clone45/EquationComposer).

Primarily, this fork modifies the default behaviour of preset synths which have
a pattern-based or sequenced component such that, when no external clock is
present, the sequence is reset to 0 and not clocked using any internal clock.
